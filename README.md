# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to prepare a visualization that would show investors the potential for a bike-share service in Des Moines, by illustrating how successful the Citibikes service is in NYC.

After review of the resource file and with the assistance of Tableau certain aspects of New York City's Citibike service were made clear. We are able to discern the following:

1. Subcriber vs Occasional Customer- Of the 2.3 million users of the service 1.9 million are subscribers and 440,000 are the occasional customer. Because of this we can assume that it is likely we would also retain majority subscribers, meaning consistent revenue.

2. Rider demographic- Of the 2.3 million users, 1.5 million are men, 588,00 are women and the remainder are of unspecified gender. 

3. Bike checkouts- The data shows that bikes are typically checked out no longer than 30 minutes. And for longer rides its still generally under 1 hour. One might assume that these fast turn overs could mean that there would be no likely risk of bike shortages.

4. Peak usage- Citibikes are used continually throughout the day but usage peaks during work commuting hours. We can also see that bikes are also used all day on weekends. 

5. Utilization and repairs- There are some bikes that seem to get the majority of use while others seem to get hardly any at all. Bike repair for those oft used bikes would be paramount to maintaining safety and customer retention. 

# Summary
The key points of this analysis are that, Citibikes service seems to attract subscribers over the occasional riders. And that men and office commuters may be our target demographic. We should also expect quick bike turn over times from riders. 
It may also be beneficial to do additional visualizations on the most popular bike stations and the demographic in those areas. We could also gain more insight from comparing this August data to a colder month to see the difference in usage betweent the two.
